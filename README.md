# Libft
A personal library of basic, useful C-functions and data structures for string handling, I/O memory management and more.

Libft is a central project of the 42-pedagogy. The idea is that instead of using the C standard library in their school projects, 42-students implement their own library. Students are encouraged to improve and expand their Libft throughout their studies. In this way Libft teaches students the importance of writing maintainable and reusable code.

Many of the mandatory functions of Libft are reimplementations of functions from the C standard library.
